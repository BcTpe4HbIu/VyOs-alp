This directory contains files that are used by live-helper during the build
process.

binary_local-includes:
  Files in this sub-directory are copied into the binary directory during the
  binary step (before the image is built).

chroot_apt:
  The "preferences" file is used by apt during the chroot step.

chroot_local-hooks:
  The scripts in this sub-directory are executed (chrooted) during the chroot
  step (after packages are installed).

chroot_local-includes:
  Files in this sub-directory are copied into the chroot directory during the
  chroot step (after packages are installed).

chroot_local-packageslists:
  This sub-directory contains package lists that specify what packages should
  be installed. The lists that should be used are specified using the
  LH_PACKAGES_LISTS variable in "mk.livecd.conf".

  Note that the "vyatta-kernel.*" lists correspond to the various kernel
  flavors. For example, the packages in "vyatta-kernel.586-vyatta" will be
  included if the "586-vyatta" kernel flavor is specified for the build
  (through top-level configure). For now, all packages that directly *or*
  indirectly depend on the specific kernel flavor must be included in the
  flavor-specific list and *not* in one of the generic lists. For example,
  "wanpipe" depends on the 586-vyatta wanpipe-modules package, which depends
  on the 586-vyatta kernel, and therefore "wanpipe" is listed in
  "vyatta-kernel.586-vyatta" and not in "vyatta-full".

chroot_local-patches:
  This sub-directory contains patches that are applied during the chroot
  step (after packages are installed).

chroot_sources:
  The files in this sub-directory specify the package repositories that should
  be added to sources.list during the chroot step. The ".gpg" files are the
  keys corresponding to the repositories.
