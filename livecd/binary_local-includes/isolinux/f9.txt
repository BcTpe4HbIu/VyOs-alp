If you have trouble installing Vyatta, don't despair! You have a couple of
options
  1. If you are a Vyatta subscriptions customer, you can contact the Vyatta
     Technical Assistance Center (VTAC)
  2. If you are using the Vyatta Community Edition (VC), you can get help from
     the Vyatta community at http://www.vyatta.com .  For best results when
     posting your issue, try to be as specific as you can about what version of
     Vyatta and the exact hardware, including any optional hardware, you are
     trying to use.  Include a specific description of the failure condition or
     error message.

We are especially interested in hearing about installation problems.
Generally, installation problems happen to multiple people and you can help us
solve a problem for others who may follow you.  Vyatta is committed to
supporting an ever-increasing set of hardware, and while we can't commit to
supporting everything, we want to understand which hardware is the source of
problems.

See the Vyatta Quick Start Guide for more information available at the Vyatta
