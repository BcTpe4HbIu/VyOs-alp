You must have at least 32 megabytes of RAM to use this installer.  Vyatta
recommends at least 512 megabytes of RAM for basic system usage.  You will need
more RAM if you plan on working with large routing tables or advanced
functionality.

You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 512 megabytes to install the base system. You'll need more
disk space to install additional packages, and to provide expansion for future
upgrades.
